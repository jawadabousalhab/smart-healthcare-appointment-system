{"model":"llama3.2","created_at":"2025-04-29T17:38:24.7643177Z","response":"Based on the provided data, I've analyzed the doctor's schedule and predicted their availability for the next 7 days.\n\n**Historical Analysis**\n\nFrom the given data, we can observe the following patterns:\n\n1. The doctor tends to have longer gaps between appointments (e.g., April 21st - April 30th is approximately 9 days).\n2. There are two consecutive cancellations on May 10th and 11th.\n3. The doctor seems to have a consistent appointment time slot of 01:20:00.\n\n**Predicted Availability for the Next 7 Days**\n\nBased on these patterns, here's a predicted availability calendar for the next 7 days:\n\n* April 25th:\n\t+ Available from 01:20:00 - 02:30:00 (1 hour and 10 minutes)\n\t+ Warning: Overbooking potential, as there are no appointments scheduled in this time slot.\n* April 26th:\n\t+ Available from 01:20:00 - 03:30:00 (2 hours and 10 minutes)\n* April 27th:\n\t+ Available from 08:00:00 - 12:00:00 (4 hours)\n* April 28th:\n\t+ Available from 01:20:00 - 02:30:00 (1 hour and 10 minutes)\n* April 29th:\n\t+ Available from 23:30:38 - 01:20:00 (1 hour and 50 minutes), with a gap of 2 hours after the scheduled appointment time\n* May 1st:\n\t+ Available from 01:20:00 - 03:30:00 (2 hours and 10 minutes)\n* May 2nd:\n\t+ Available from 08:03:44 - 12:00:00 (3 hours and 56 minutes)\n\n**Flagged Scheduling Conflicts**\n\nBased on the predicted availability, I've flagged potential scheduling conflicts:\n\n1. April 29th has a gap of 2 hours after the scheduled appointment time. It's recommended to schedule an appointment during this time slot to avoid overbooking.\n2. May 10th and 11th are still marked as cancellations, which indicates that these days might be best avoided for scheduling appointments.\n\nPlease note that this analysis is based on historical data and may not account for unforeseen circumstances or changes in the doctor's schedule.","done":true,"done_reason":"stop","context":[128006,9125,128007,271,38766,1303,33025,2696,25,6790,220,2366,18,271,128009,128006,882,128007,271,2675,527,264,6593,15592,18328,42118,264,10896,596,9899,13,5810,374,279,10896,596,18101,828,1473,12,2696,25,220,2366,20,12,2371,12,868,11,4212,25,220,1419,25,966,25,1987,11,8266,25,8308,198,12,2696,25,220,2366,20,12,2371,12,1114,11,4212,25,220,1419,25,1927,25,2790,11,8266,25,8308,198,12,2696,25,220,2366,20,12,2371,12,777,11,4212,25,220,2318,25,2839,25,2096,11,8266,25,8308,198,12,2696,25,220,2366,20,12,2371,12,1691,11,4212,25,220,1721,25,508,25,410,11,8266,25,8308,198,12,2696,25,220,2366,20,12,2371,12,1313,11,4212,25,220,1721,25,508,25,410,11,8266,25,8308,198,12,2696,25,220,2366,20,12,2371,12,966,11,4212,25,220,605,25,410,25,410,11,8266,25,26765,198,12,2696,25,220,2366,20,12,2304,12,605,11,4212,25,220,2437,25,410,25,410,11,8266,25,26765,271,29815,389,420,828,323,279,2768,1715,25,38527,3059,856,18101,9899,323,7168,856,18539,369,279,1828,220,22,2919,13,21829,856,14595,18101,12912,11,33251,1990,37256,11,323,13970,38952,13,40665,3230,892,10215,994,358,2846,4461,311,387,2561,11,323,5292,904,4754,38952,26885,13,15392,701,2077,449,2867,2561,892,10215,323,904,19530,922,927,21978,13,128009,128006,78191,128007,271,29815,389,279,3984,828,11,358,3077,30239,279,10896,596,9899,323,19698,872,18539,369,279,1828,220,22,2919,382,334,50083,950,18825,57277,3915,279,2728,828,11,584,649,23846,279,2768,12912,1473,16,13,578,10896,28335,311,617,5129,33251,1990,37256,320,68,1326,2637,5936,220,1691,267,482,5936,220,966,339,374,13489,220,24,2919,4390,17,13,2684,527,1403,24871,18974,811,389,3297,220,605,339,323,220,806,339,627,18,13,578,10896,5084,311,617,264,13263,18101,892,9633,315,220,1721,25,508,25,410,382,334,54644,291,52910,369,279,9479,220,22,21882,57277,29815,389,1521,12912,11,1618,596,264,19698,18539,13470,369,279,1828,220,22,2919,1473,9,5936,220,914,339,512,197,10,16528,505,220,1721,25,508,25,410,482,220,2437,25,966,25,410,320,16,6596,323,220,605,4520,340,197,10,27956,25,6193,21978,4754,11,439,1070,527,912,37256,13847,304,420,892,9633,627,9,5936,220,1627,339,512,197,10,16528,505,220,1721,25,508,25,410,482,220,2839,25,966,25,410,320,17,4207,323,220,605,4520,340,9,5936,220,1544,339,512,197,10,16528,505,220,2318,25,410,25,410,482,220,717,25,410,25,410,320,19,4207,340,9,5936,220,1591,339,512,197,10,16528,505,220,1721,25,508,25,410,482,220,2437,25,966,25,410,320,16,6596,323,220,605,4520,340,9,5936,220,1682,339,512,197,10,16528,505,220,1419,25,966,25,1987,482,220,1721,25,508,25,410,320,16,6596,323,220,1135,4520,705,449,264,13225,315,220,17,4207,1306,279,13847,18101,892,198,9,3297,220,16,267,512,197,10,16528,505,220,1721,25,508,25,410,482,220,2839,25,966,25,410,320,17,4207,323,220,605,4520,340,9,3297,220,17,303,512,197,10,16528,505,220,2318,25,2839,25,2096,482,220,717,25,410,25,410,320,18,4207,323,220,3487,4520,696,334,12409,3640,328,45456,15323,57545,57277,29815,389,279,19698,18539,11,358,3077,62309,4754,38952,26885,1473,16,13,5936,220,1682,339,706,264,13225,315,220,17,4207,1306,279,13847,18101,892,13,1102,596,11349,311,9899,459,18101,2391,420,892,9633,311,5766,927,21978,627,17,13,3297,220,605,339,323,220,806,339,527,2103,13160,439,18974,811,11,902,15151,430,1521,2919,2643,387,1888,31890,369,38952,37256,382,5618,5296,430,420,6492,374,3196,389,13970,828,323,1253,539,2759,369,96691,29412,13463,477,4442,304,279,10896,596,9899,13],"total_duration":159903108000,"load_duration":22471322500,"prompt_eval_count":286,"prompt_eval_duration":40957591700,"eval_count":496,"eval_duration":95043699000}
